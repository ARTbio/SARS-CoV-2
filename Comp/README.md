# Comparative analysis of coronovirus sequences

## What's the point?

What is the phylogenetic relationship between assembled sequences and other coronaviruses?

## Outline

We mapped Unicycler assembly produces at [step 1](https://github.com/galaxyproject/SARS-CoV-2/tree/master/Assembly) against `nr` database at NCBI using `blastn`  and downloaded [hit table](4GRC05K5014-Alignment-HitTable.csv). This analysis indicated that our assembly is 100% identical to [NC_045512](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512).

We then used this hit table to Galaxy workflow that:

 1. downloaded sequences
 2. aligned downloaded sequences against COVID-19 reference [NC_045512](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512) using `lastz`
 3. identified sequences that align with at least 75% of NC_045512
 4. created multiple alignment of sequences from the previous step using `mafft`
 5. computed a maximum likelihood tree using `iqtree`

## Inputs

The analysis takes two inputs:

 1. Hit table generated by blast
 2. Genbank file for COVID-19 reference genome [NC_045512](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512)

 The hit table has the following format:

 ```
COVID-19,MN988668.1,100.000,29781,0,0,1,29781,29838,58,0.0,54996
COVID-19,NC_045512.2,100.000,29781,0,0,1,29781,29839,59,0.0,54996
COVID-19,MN994468.1,99.993,29781,2,0,1,29781,29839,59,0.0,54985
COVID-19,MN985325.1,99.990,29781,3,0,1,29781,29839,59,0.0,54979
COVID-19,MN938384.1,99.990,29781,3,0,1,29781,29807,27,0.0,54979
COVID-19,MN997409.1,99.987,29781,4,0,1,29781,29839,59,0.0,54974
COVID-19,MN975262.1,99.983,29781,5,0,1,29781,29839,59,0.0,54968
....
```

the workflow extracts accession numbers (the second column) and uses them to download corresponding sequences in FASTA format.
