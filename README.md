The is a companion to the manuscript describing the analysis of early SARS-CoV-2 data. It contains description of workflows and exact versions of all software used. 

It contains the following steps:

  1. [Pre-processing of raw read data](https://github.com/galaxyproject/SARS-CoV-2/tree/master/PreProcessing)
  2. [Assembly of SARS-CoV-2 genome](https://github.com/galaxyproject/SARS-CoV-2/tree/master/Assembly)
  3. Comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and closely related coronaviruses
  4. [Estimation of timing for most common recent ancestor (MCRA])(https://github.com/galaxyproject/SARS-CoV-2/tree/master/MCRA)
  5. [Analysis of variation within individual isolates](https://github.com/galaxyproject/SARS-CoV-2/tree/master/Variation)
  6. [Analysis of Spike protein substitutions](https://github.com/galaxyproject/SARS-CoV-2/tree/master/Alignment)
  7. Analysis of recombination

  The analyses have been performed on [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org) platform using open source tools from [BioConda](https://bioconda.github.io/). All tools were run on [XSEDE](https://www.xsede.org/) resources maintained by the Texas Advanced Computing Center ([TACC](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/)), Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center ([PSC](https://www.psc.edu/)), and [Indiana University](https://jetstream-cloud.org/).
